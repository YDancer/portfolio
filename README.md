# Welcome to a website all about ME!

I made this website to learn ReactJS and attempt to build a portfolio at the same time.
As it stands right now I am still just a beginner in the React space and have not unlocked the more powerful potential of React.
Nevertheless, I have still created this website from scratch. 


# Made with React + Vite
npm version used was 10.9.2

# General Program Structure
src/components folder contains all components of the project

Project uses -> ImageModal, Slideshow and Sidebar
ProjectAlt uses -> ImageModal, Slideshow, Sidebar, and BottomBar
Navbar uses -> NavbarButton
Note that: ImageModal also uses Slideshow
Essentially the above mentioned 4 components use other components, otherwise each component is standalone.

src folder contains Body, Footer, Header components, which are the main elements of the document

src/data folder contains all the text and image paths of a project
for further information there is a readme there


# Bucket list (TO DO in the future)
- Animations
- Separate Web Pages (Will be a comprehensive list of all my worked on projects) I hope to be able to get to this point
- Click functionality on the slideshow
- Arrow key functionality on slideshow
- General optimizations
- SVG Background Trimming
