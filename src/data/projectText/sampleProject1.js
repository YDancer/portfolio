const projObj = ```
This is a whole load of text and i figured this would be an easier way to store
when i'm finished typing everything, i'll export this variable. 
Now this is the objective of whatever i was making. So in essence what were we/I trying to acheive
Or in essence what is the project about

Generally there should be even more text for this objective, enough but this is just an example after all
```;

const moreRole = ```
Hey guess what, this is another large area of text, dedicated to a sidebar. 
This section is dedicated to things that I did specifically among the project
now i'm keeping this one shorter for 

the placeholder text anyways. I think it'll be fine
```;

export {projObj, moreRole};
