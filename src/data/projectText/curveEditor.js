const projObj = `
The objective of this project was to create a fully functional 3D curve editor using OpenGL. 
This editor displays two types of curves, namely Bezier and B-Spline curves. 
It also allows you to create, modify, and delete the control points of the curve. 
Because the editor is 3D, there is 3D functionality such as a camera, and two sample tensor product surfaces that are viewable. 
Finally, using the drawn curve in the editor, a surface of revolution can be constructed and viewed in 3D.

const moreRole = `
This was an introduction to the viewing pipeline in computer graphics,
 and that was put into practice by implementing the perspective camera in the editor. 
 Parameterizing curves and surfaces was another thing I learned in the development of this application. 
 The Bezier curves were implemented by sampling points along the defined curve in short steps, 
 and the B-Spline curves were implemented by Chaikinâ€™s Subdivision Algorithm.
