const projObj = `
Tasked with creating different types of fractals using OpenGL, this project was essentially an orientation of sorts. 
Learning the rasterization pipeline, how OpenGL renders, the coordinate system, keyboard input, the render loop,
recursive construction of fractals, and much more was learned in the development of this application. 
At the end of the day, itâ€™s also very neat!
