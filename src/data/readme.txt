projImport.js
    This file imports all image and text data to go into project sections on portfolio
    This is to help organize imports and ease addition of extra sections
    
    In order to add more, create a new js file in the projectText directory
    Then add all the respective fields required (see an example project to see which ones, or the actual Body component)
    Next make sure the images are imported

    Now go to the projImport.js file, and add in the new file into the export array (assuming you import it too)
