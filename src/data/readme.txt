Projects.json:
    Projects json file assumes that the imageDir are in the src/assets/Projects folder
    It also assumes that all files in the subfolder of ex: src/assets/Projects/proj1 are images

    Furthermore, those images are assigned descriptions alphabetically
    Ex: 1.png, a.jpg, 35.jpg should be ordered as follows: [1.png, 35.jpg, a.jpg]

    Note that larger text sections (like objective, my role) will be stored in seperate js files, just for cleaner organization
    Assuming that it is in the src/data/projectText folder
